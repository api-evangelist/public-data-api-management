			<h2>I am Kin Lane, the API Evangelist...</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I have been studying APIs, and specifically API management as a full time project since the summer of 2010. I study how companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are making data, content, and algorithms acessible in a secure way using the web. My research has led me to work on a number of public data projects from making facts and other data available via simple APIs, all the way to working with the White House to help government agencies make their public data assets more accessible.</p>
		<p>My API Evangelist research is made up of several hundred open data and API research projects, all hosted on Github as machine readable data portals. This API research project is dedicated to a conversation around how we can better fund public data efforts using APIs, and modern approaches to API management. It is a standalone website, with backend research that I can shuffle and reorganize on a regular basis, helping me make sense of the conversation around generating revenue around public data using API management. Come back often, as I'll be regularly adding, updating, and shuffling my research here to help push forward this conversation in any way I can.</p>

			<h2>What Is An API?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Application Programming Interfaces, or called APIs are increasingly how data, content, media, and algorithms are being shared online. APIs are used to deliver information to website, mobile applications, devices, and other systems and applications. APIs are not new, but this latest generation of APIs are built using low cost, ubiquitous web technology, and allows for a wide level of adoption, and ease of use across many types of applications.</p>
		<p>APIs are often available when it comes to accessing public data on the web. CSV, XML, YAML, JSON, and other data file formats are being made available at common urls, exposing data over the web. APIs allow for the data to be used in as many possible ways and tries to make as few assumptions as possible regarding the actual end application--focusing on making the data as accessible, and machine readable as possible.</p>
