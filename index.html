		<p>I have been studying APIs, and specifically API management as a full time project since the summer of 2010. I study how companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are making data, content, and algorithms acessible in a secure way using the web. My research has led me to work on a number of public data projects from making facts and other data available via simple APIs, all the way to working with the White House to help government agencies make their public data assets more accessible.</p>
		<p>My API Evangelist research is made up of several hundred open data and API research projects, all hosted on Github as machine readable data portals. This API research project is dedicated to a conversation around how we can better fund public data efforts using APIs, and modern approaches to API management. It is a standalone website, with backend research that I can shuffle and reorganize on a regular basis, helping me make sense of the conversation around generating revenue around public data using API management. Come back often, as I'll be regularly adding, updating, and shuffling my research here to help push forward this conversation in any way I can.</p>

			<h2>What Is An API?</h2>

		<p>Application Programming Interfaces, or called APIs are increasingly how data, content, media, and algorithms are being shared online. APIs are used to deliver information to website, mobile applications, devices, and other systems and applications. APIs are not new, but this latest generation of APIs are built using low cost, ubiquitous web technology, and allows for a wide level of adoption, and ease of use across many types of applications.</p>
		<p>APIs are often available when it comes to accessing public data on the web. CSV, XML, YAML, JSON, and other data file formats are being made available at common urls, exposing data over the web. APIs allow for the data to be used in as many possible ways and tries to make as few assumptions as possible regarding the actual end application--focusing on making the data as accessible, and machine readable as possible.</p>
		<p>APIs make public data easier to use in a wide variety of applications, using common data formats and schema, available on the web.Even if public data is available on a website, it should also be made available via an API. Making public data usable in as may places as possible, beyond just a single website.</p>

			<h2>What Is API Management?</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" align="right" width="25%" />
		<p>While public data is being made available on the web using simple URLs, it is not always 100% publicly available. Over the last decade startups have developed standardized approaches to requiring all data consumers sign up for an account, receive API keys, which they have to provide with every call to an API, and request for data they make. API management provides a base set of tools to help data stewards manage the access to their valuable data, content, and algorithms in a way that meets their objectives.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - All API consumption requires consumers sign up for an account and pass in their API keys with each call they make, ensuring all consumption of data is authenticated.</li>
			<li><strong>Plans</strong> - The establishment of different plans for access, often providing free, but limited plans to new users, and higher volume, often paid plans for partners, and other trusted consumers.</li>
			<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - All API consumption is metered and rate limits are imposed to incentivize certain behavior, and restrict access by bad actors.</li>
			<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Providing dashboard and reporting on all API consumption by application and plan, showing who has consumed what, accounting for all data consumption.</li>
			<li><strong>Invoicing</strong> - Producing of reports or invoices that accout for all API consumption across plans, and breaking down consumption in terms of value created, or extracted, and apply credits appropriately.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>API management is how Amazon invented the cloud with Amazon Web Services. Amazon made storage, compute, and other more programmatic resources available via APIs, and imposed a pay as you go API management layer for all consumption. This approach to API management is used by Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and every other tech firm to meter and manage access and consumption of their valuable resources--public data stewards should be doing the same.</p>
