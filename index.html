		<p>I have been studying APIs, and specifically API management as a full time project since the summer of 2010. I study how companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are making data, content, and algorithms acessible in a secure way using the web. My research has led me to work on a number of public data projects from making facts and other data available via simple APIs, all the way to working with the White House to help government agencies make their public data assets more accessible.</p>
		<p>My API Evangelist research is made up of several hundred open data and API research projects, all hosted on Github as machine readable data portals. This API research project is dedicated to a conversation around how we can better fund public data efforts using APIs, and modern approaches to API management. It is a standalone website, with backend research that I can shuffle and reorganize on a regular basis, helping me make sense of the conversation around generating revenue around public data using API management. Come back often, as I'll be regularly adding, updating, and shuffling my research here to help push forward this conversation in any way I can.</p>

			<h2>What Is An API?</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-question-mark.png" alt="" align="right" width="20%" />
		<p>Application Programming Interfaces, or called APIs are increasingly how data, content, media, and algorithms are being shared online. APIs are used to deliver information to website, mobile applications, devices, and other systems and applications. APIs are not new, but this latest generation of APIs are built using low cost, ubiquitous web technology, and allows for a wide level of adoption, and ease of use across many types of applications.</p>
		<p>APIs are often available when it comes to accessing public data on the web. CSV, XML, YAML, JSON, and other data file formats are being made available at common urls, exposing data over the web. APIs allow for the data to be used in as many possible ways and tries to make as few assumptions as possible regarding the actual end application--focusing on making the data as accessible, and machine readable as possible.</p>
		<p>APIs make public data easier to use in a wide variety of applications, using common data formats and schema, available on the web.Even if public data is available on a website, it should also be made available via an API. Making public data usable in as may places as possible, beyond just a single website.</p>

			<h2>What Is API Management?</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-tools.png" alt="" align="right" width="20%" />
		<p>While public data is being made available on the web using simple URLs, it is not always 100% publicly available. Over the last decade startups have developed standardized approaches to requiring all data consumers sign up for an account, receive API keys, which they have to provide with every call to an API, and request for data they make. API management provides a base set of tools to help data stewards manage the access to their valuable data, content, and algorithms in a way that meets their objectives.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Authentication</strong> - All API consumption requires consumers sign up for an account and pass in their API keys with each call they make, ensuring all consumption of data is authenticated.</li>
			<li><strong>Plans</strong> - The establishment of different plans for access, often providing free, but limited plans to new users, and higher volume, often paid plans for partners, and other trusted consumers.</li>
			<li><strong>Rate Limits</strong> - All API consumption is metered and rate limits are imposed to incentivize certain behavior, and restrict access by bad actors.</li>
			<li><strong>Analysis</strong> - Providing dashboard and reporting on all API consumption by application and plan, showing who has consumed what, accounting for all data consumption.</li>
			<li><strong>Invoicing</strong> - Producing of reports or invoices that accout for all API consumption across plans, and breaking down consumption in terms of value created, or extracted, and apply credits appropriately.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>API management is how Amazon invented the cloud with Amazon Web Services. Amazon made storage, compute, and other more programmatic resources available via APIs, and imposed a pay as you go API management layer for all consumption. This approach to API management is used by Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and every other tech firm to meter and manage access and consumption of their valuable resources--public data stewards should be doing the same.</p>

			<h2>Generate Revenue From Public Data Using APIs</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/public-data-api-management/parks-prohibit-commercial-use.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>When I first mention the concept of generating revenue from public data, the usual response from people is to push back. "Public data shouldn't be locked up, it should be free!". However, as almost everyone other business sector is opening its eyes to the value of data, and the ability to generate revenue, the one aspect our society that should be waking up to the concept is the stewards of our public data. This data has value to its owners, and value to the public, and there is no reason public data stewards shouldn't be able to generate operational revenue from the value they possess, when used in commercial situations.</p>
		<p>It is common place to charge companies for access and usage of physical public resources, we just haven't had the same conversation around around digital public resources. National parks still charge fees, and require special permits to sell products and services on, or put water, trees, land, and other resources to use. There is no reason this same approach can't be applied to valuable national parks data, and the activity of citizens around these parks. There is no reason we cannot generate essential revenue from commercial acess to public data, ensuring companies help carry the load to keep valuable public data available, and useful.</p>

			<h2>Leveraging API Management</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-manage-operations.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>I'd like to argue that APIs, and specifically API management has been well established in the private sector, and increasingly in the public sector, for making valuable data and content available online in a secure and measurable way. Companies like Amazon, Google, and even Twitter are using APIs to make data freely available, but through API management are limiting how much any single consumer can access, and even charging per API call to generate revenue from 3rd party developers and partners. This proven technique for making data and content accessible online using low-cost web technology, requiring all consumers to sign up for a unique set of keys, then rate limiting access, and establishing different levels of access tiers to identify and organize different types of consumer, can and should be applied in government agencies and non-profit organizations to make data accessible, while also asserting more control over how it is used.</p>

			<h2>Commercial Use of Public Data</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/public-data-api-management/no-parking-commercial-vehicles.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>While this concept can apply to almost any type of data, for the purposes of this example, I am going to focus on 211 data, or the organizations, locations, and services offered by municipipalities and non-profit organzations to hep increase accesss and awareness of health and human services. With 211 data it is obvious that you want this information to be freely available, and accessible by those who need it. However, there are plenty of commercial interests who are interested in this same data, and are using it to sell advertising against, or enrich other datasets, and products or serviecs. There is not reason why cash strapped cities, and non-profit organizations carry the load to maintain, and serve up data for free, whent the consumers are using it for commercial purposes. We do not freely give away physical public resources to commercial interests (well, ok, sometimes), without expecting something in return, why would we behave differently with our virtual public resources?</p>

			<h2>It Costs Money To Serve Public Data</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-servers.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>Providing access to public data online costs money. It takes money to run the database, servers, bandwidth, and webiste and application being used to serve up data. It takes money to clean the data, validate phone numbers, email addresses, and ensure the data is of a certain quality and brings value to end-users. Yes this data should be made freely available to those who need it. However, the non-profit organizations and government agencies who are stewards of the data shouldn't be carrying the financial burden of this data remaining freely available to commercial entities who are looking to enrich their products and services, or simply generate advertising revenue from public data. As modern API providers have learned there are always a variety of API consumers, and I'm recommending that public data stewards begin leverage APIs, and API management to better understand who is accessing their data, and begin to put them into separate buckets, and understand who should be sharing the financial burden of providing public data.</p>

			<h2>Public Data Should Be Free To The Public</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-open-data.jpg" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>If it is public data, it should be freely available to the public. One the web, and through the API. The average citizen should be able to come use human service websites to find services, as well as us the API to help them in their efforts to help others find services. As soon as any application of the public data moves into the commercial realm, and the storage, server, and bandwidth costs increase, they shouldn't be able to offload the risk and costs to the platform, and be forced to help carry load when it comes to covering platform costs. API management is a great way to measure each application consumption, and then meter and quantify their role and impact, and either allow them to remain freely accessing information, or be forced to pay a fee for API access and consumption.</p>

			<h2>Ensuring Commercial Usage Helps Carry The Load</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-recycling.jpg" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>Commercial API usage will have a distinctly different usage fingerprint than the everage citizen, or smaller non-commercial application. API consumers can be asked to declare they application upon signing up for API access, as well as be identified throught their consumption and traffic patterns. API management excels at metering and analyzing API traffic to understand where it is being applied, either on the web or in mobile, as well as in system to system, and other machine learning or big data analysis scenarios. Public data stewards should be in the business of requiring ALL API consumers sign up for a key which they include with each call, allowing the platform to identify and measure consumption in real-time, and on recurring basis.</p>

			<h2>API Plans & Access Tiers For Public Data</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-plan.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>Modern approaches to API management lean on the concept of plans or access tiers to segment out consumers of valuable resources. You see this present in software as a service (SaaS) offerings who ofen have starter, professional, and entprise levels of access. Lower levels of the access plan might be free, or low cost, but as you ascend up the ladder, and engage with platforms at different levels, you pay different monthly, as well as usage costs. While also enjoying different levels of access, and loosened rate limits, depending on the plan you operate within. API plans allows platforms to target different types of consumers with different types of resources, and revenue levels. Something that should be adopted by public data stewards, helping establish common access levels that reflect their objectives, as well as is in alignment with a variety of API consumers.</p>

			<h2>Quantifying, Invoicing, And Understanding Consumption</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-invoice.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>The private sector focuses on API management as a revenue generator. Each API call is identified and measure, grouping each API consumers usage by plan, and attaching a value to their access. It is common to charge API consumers for each API call they make, but there are a number of other ways to meter and charge for consumption. There is also the posibility of paying for usage on some APIs, where specific behavior is being encouraged. API calls, both reading and writing, can be operated like a credit system, accumulating credits, as well as the spending of credits, or translation of credits into currency, and back again. API management allows for the value generated, and extracted from public data resources is measured, quantified, and invoiced for even if money is never actually transacted. API management is often used to show the exchange of value between internal groups, partners, as well as with 3rd party public developers as we see commonly across the Internet today.</p>

			<h2>Sponsoring, Grants, And Continued Investment in Public Data</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-invest-api.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>Turning the open data conversation around using APIs, will open up direct revenue opportunities for agencies and organizations from charging for volume and commercial levels of access. It will also open up the discussion around other types of investment that can be made. Revenue generated from commercial use can go back into the platform itself, as well as funding different applications of the data--further benefitting the overall ecosystem. Platform partners can also be leveraged to join at specific sponsorship tiers where they aren't necessarily metered for usage, but putting money on the table to fund access, research, and innovative uses of public data--going well beyond just "making money from public data", as many open data advocates point out.</p>

			<h2>Alternative Types of Public Data Consumers</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-consumption-api.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>Discovering new applications, data sources, and partners is increasingly why companies, organizations, institutions, and government agencies are doing APIs in 2017. API portals are becoming external research and development labs for research, innovation, and development on top of digital resources being made available via APIs. Think of social science research that occurs on Twitter or Facebook, or entrpreneurs developing new machine learning tools for healthcare, or finance. Once data is available, identified as quality source of data, it will often be picked up by commercial interests building interesting things, but also university researchers, other government agencies, and potentialy data journalists and scientists. This type of consumption can contribute directly to new revenue opportunities for organization around their valuable public data, but it can also provide more insight, tooling, and other contributions to a cities or organizations overall operations.</p>

			<h2>Helping Public Data Stewards Do What They Do Best</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/bw-icons/bw-dataset.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>I'm not proposing that all public data should be generating revenue using API management. I'm proposing that there is a lot of value in these public data assets being available, and a lot of this value is being extracted by commercial entities who might not be as invested in public data stewards long term viability. In an age where many businesses of all shapes and sizes are realizing the value of data, we should be helping our government agencies, and the not for profits that serve the public good realize this as well. We should be helping them properly manage their digital data assets using APIs, and develop an awareness of who is consuming these resources, then develop partnerships, and new revenue opportunities along the way. I'm not proposing this happens behind closed doors, and follows an open API approach to providing observable, transparent access to public resources.</p>

			<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>
		</header>
		<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/kin-lane/kin-lane-api-evangelist-cartoon.png" alt="" width="20%" align="right" />
		<p>I want to see public data stewards be successful in what they do. The availability, quality, and access of public data across many business sectors is important to how the economy and our society works (or doesn't). I'm suggesting that we leverage APIs, and API management to work better for everyone involved, not just generate more money. I'm looking to help government agencies, and non-profit organizaitons who work with public data understand the potential of APIs when it comes to access to public data. I'm also looking to help them understand modern API management practices so they can get better at identifying public data consumers, understanding how they are putting their valuable data to work, and develop ways in which they can partner, and invest in the road map of public data resources. This isn't a new concept, it is just one that the public sector needs to become more aware of, and begin to establish more models for how this can work in government.</p>
